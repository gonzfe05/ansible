# SSH Role Enhancement Summary

## Overview

The SSH role has been significantly enhanced to support **both outbound and inbound SSH connections**. Previously, the role only handled client-side SSH configuration (connecting FROM the machine TO other services). Now it can also configure the machine as an SSH server (accepting connections TO the machine FROM remote clients).

## What Changed

### New Capabilities

‚úÖ **SSH Server Support** - Install and configure OpenSSH server  
‚úÖ **Remote Development Ready** - Optimized for VSCode/Cursor remote connections  
‚úÖ **Configurable Security** - Control authentication methods and security settings  
‚úÖ **Automatic Service Management** - Handles SSH daemon startup and restarts  
‚úÖ **Keep-Alive Configuration** - Prevents connection timeouts  
‚úÖ **X11 Forwarding** - Enables GUI application forwarding  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible** - Existing playbooks continue to work without changes

## New Variables

### SSH Server Configuration Variables

All variables are defined in `defaults/main.yml`:

```yaml
# Enable/disable SSH server
ssh_server_enabled: false  # Set to true to install SSH server

# Security settings
ssh_server_permit_root_login: "no"                 # Allow root login
ssh_server_pubkey_authentication: "yes"            # Public key auth
ssh_server_password_authentication: "yes"          # Password auth
ssh_server_x11_forwarding: "yes"                   # X11 forwarding

# Connection keep-alive
ssh_server_client_alive_interval: 60               # Seconds between keepalive
ssh_server_client_alive_count_max: 10              # Max keepalive attempts

# Packages to install
ssh_server_packages:
  - openssh-server
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Client-Only (Default Behavior)

This is the **default behavior** - nothing changes for existing playbooks:

```yaml
- role: ssh
  become: yes
  become_user: myuser
```

### Enable SSH Server

Add `ssh_server_enabled: true` to enable server functionality:

```yaml
- role: ssh
  vars:
    ssh_server_enabled: true
  become: yes
  become_user: myuser
```

### Full Custom Configuration

```yaml
- role: ssh
  vars:
    ssh_server_enabled: true
    ssh_server_permit_root_login: "no"
    ssh_server_password_authentication: "no"  # Keys only
    ssh_server_x11_forwarding: "yes"
    ssh_server_client_alive_interval: 120
  become: yes
  become_user: myuser
```

### Remote Development Server Setup

Complete example for VSCode/Cursor remote development:

```yaml
- name: Setup Remote Development Server
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - role: apt_installs
      vars:
        apt_installs_custom:
          - git
          - build-essential
          - python3
          - curl
      become: true
      become_user: root
    
    - role: ssh
      vars:
        ssh_server_enabled: true
      become: yes
      become_user: developer
    
    - role: vscode
      become: true
      become_user: root
```

See `playbooks/remote_ssh_server_v2.yaml` for a complete working example.

## Migration Guide

### If You're Using `remote_ssh_server.yaml`

**Old approach** (manual configuration):
```yaml
- role: apt_installs
  vars:
    apt_installs_custom:
      - openssh-server
      - git
      - ...
  become: true
  
tasks:
  - name: Ensure SSH service is enabled
    systemd:
      name: ssh
      state: started
      
  - name: Configure SSH
    lineinfile:
      path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      # ... manual configuration
```

**New approach** (using SSH role):
```yaml
- role: apt_installs
  vars:
    apt_installs_custom:
      - git
      # openssh-server automatically installed by ssh role
  become: true

- role: ssh
  vars:
    ssh_server_enabled: true
  become: yes
  become_user: myuser
```

### If You're Using `after_format.yaml`

The playbook already uses the SSH role for client configuration. To enable server functionality, uncomment the vars section:

```yaml
- role: ssh
  vars:
    ssh_server_enabled: true  # Uncomment this line
  become: true
  become_user: aleph
```

## Testing

The role includes comprehensive molecule tests for both client and server functionality:

```bash
cd playbooks/roles/ssh
molecule test
```

Tests verify:
- ‚úÖ SSH client installation
- ‚úÖ SSH key setup
- ‚úÖ SSH agent functionality
- ‚úÖ GitHub connection
- ‚úÖ SSH server installation (when enabled)
- ‚úÖ SSH service status
- ‚úÖ Server configuration
- ‚úÖ Port availability

## Security Recommendations

After setting up SSH server, follow these security best practices:

### 1. Set Up SSH Keys

On your **local machine**:
```bash
# Generate key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy to server
ssh-copy-id user@server-ip
```

### 2. Disable Password Authentication

After verifying key-based authentication works:
```yaml
- role: ssh
  vars:
    ssh_server_enabled: true
    ssh_server_password_authentication: "no"  # Keys only!
```

### 3. Configure Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

### 4. Monitor Access

```bash
# View SSH logs
sudo journalctl -u ssh -f

# Check failed attempts
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```

### 5. Consider fail2ban

Install fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks:
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```

## Connecting from Remote Clients

### Find Your Server's IP

```bash
# On the server
hostname -I
# or
ip addr show
```

### Connect from VSCode

1. Install "Remote - SSH" extension
2. Press `F1` ‚Üí "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"
3. Enter: `username@server-ip`

### Connect from Cursor

1. Click remote indicator (bottom-left corner)
2. Select "Connect to Host"
3. Enter: `username@server-ip`

## Tags Support

Use tags for selective execution:

```bash
# Install/configure SSH server only
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags ssh-server

# Update configuration only
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags config

# Install packages only
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags packages
```

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Server Not Starting

```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status ssh

# Check configuration
sudo sshd -t

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u ssh -n 50
```

### Can't Connect from Remote Client

```bash
# Test connection
ssh user@server-ip

# Check if port is open
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :22

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
```

### Permission Denied

```bash
# Verify key is in authorized_keys
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.ssh
# Should be: drwx------ (700) for .ssh
# Should be: -rw------- (600) for authorized_keys
```

## Benefits of This Enhancement

1. **Unified Configuration** - One role handles both client and server SSH
2. **Maintainability** - Role-based approach is easier to maintain than manual tasks
3. **Consistency** - Same configuration style as other roles
4. **Testability** - Molecule tests ensure everything works
5. **Flexibility** - Highly configurable via variables
6. **Security** - Best practices built-in by default
7. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples
8. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing playbooks work without changes

## Next Steps

1. **For New Setups**: Use `ssh_server_enabled: true` when you need SSH server
2. **For Existing Setups**: Continue using as before (client-only is default)
3. **For Remote Development**: See `remote_ssh_server_v2.yaml` example
4. **For Testing**: Run `molecule test` to verify functionality

## Questions?

- Review the comprehensive README: `playbooks/roles/ssh/README.md`
- Check the examples: `playbooks/remote_ssh_server_v2.yaml`
- Run molecule tests: `cd playbooks/roles/ssh && molecule test`

---

**Summary**: The SSH role is now a complete SSH management solution that handles both outbound connections (client) and inbound connections (server), making it perfect for both development and remote access scenarios. üöÄ
