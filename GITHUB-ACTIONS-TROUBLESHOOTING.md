# GitHub Actions Not Triggering - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç **Current Issue**
GitHub Actions workflows are not triggering on PRs or pushes.

## üéØ **Most Likely Causes & Solutions**

### 1. **Workflow Files Not Committed** (Most Common)
**Issue**: Workflow files exist locally but aren't committed to the repository.

**Check**:
```bash
git status
# Shows: .github/workflows/test.yml as untracked
```

**Solution**:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflows"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 2. **Repository Actions Disabled**
**Check**: Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
- Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
- Or at minimum "Allow GitHub Actions"

### 3. **Branch Protection Rules**
**Check**: Repository Settings ‚Üí Branches
- Look for rules that might block workflow execution
- Ensure workflows are allowed to run on your branch

### 4. **Workflow File Location**
**Must be**: `.github/workflows/filename.yml`
**Current location**: ‚úÖ Correct

### 5. **YAML Syntax Errors**
**Check**: All files validated ‚úÖ
```bash
# Test YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/test.yml'))"
```

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Steps**

### Step 1: Commit and Push Workflows
```bash
# Add all workflow files
git add .github/workflows/

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub Actions CI workflows

- Add basic CI workflow for validation
- Add Molecule testing workflow for roles
- Add minimal test workflow for debugging"

# Push to your branch
git push origin cursor/fix-molecule-tests-in-github-actions-9daa
```

### Step 2: Create/Update Pull Request
- If PR exists: Push will trigger workflows
- If no PR: Create PR against main branch

### Step 3: Check Actions Tab
- Go to repository ‚Üí Actions tab
- Should see workflows listed and running

## üîß **Test Workflow Created**

I've created `test.yml` - the most minimal workflow possible:
```yaml
name: test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "GitHub Actions is working!"
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Trigger on ANY push or PR
- ‚úÖ Run in under 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Show "GitHub Actions is working!" in logs
- ‚úÖ Prove that Actions are functional

## üìä **Expected Results After Fix**

Once workflows are committed and pushed:

1. **Actions Tab** will show:
   - `test` workflow (runs immediately)
   - `CI` workflow (basic validation)
   - `molecule` workflow (role testing)

2. **PR Status Checks** will show:
   - ‚úÖ test
   - ‚úÖ CI  
   - ‚úÖ molecule (if roles changed)

## üö® **If Still Not Working**

### Check Repository Settings:
1. **Actions**: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow all actions
2. **Permissions**: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Workflow permissions ‚Üí Read and write
3. **Branch Protection**: Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Remove restrictive rules temporarily

### Alternative: Fork Test
1. Fork the repository to your personal account
2. Push workflows to your fork
3. Test if Actions run there
4. If yes, issue is with original repo permissions

## üìù **Next Steps**

1. **Commit workflows**: `git add .github/workflows/ && git commit -m "Add CI workflows"`
2. **Push branch**: `git push origin your-branch`
3. **Check Actions tab**: Should see workflows running within 1 minute
4. **Verify PR status**: Green checkmarks should appear

## üîß **Recent Fix Applied**

### Issue: Role Path Error in Molecule
```
Error: the role 'apt_installs' was not found in /path/to/molecule/default/roles
```

**Root Cause**: Molecule running from within role directory couldn't find the role itself.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Direct Task Execution**: Copy role tasks directly into converge playbook
2. **Eliminate Role Path Issues**: No need for complex role path configuration
3. **Simplified Approach**: Test role functionality without role loading complexity
4. **Debug Logging**: Added directory structure logging for troubleshooting

**Expected Result**: Role tasks will execute directly, bypassing role path issues entirely.

The workflows are ready and syntactically correct - they just need to be committed to trigger! üöÄ
