# CI Setup Summary

## ✅ GitHub Actions Workflows Created

### 1. Basic CI (`ci.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures CI runs on every PR
- **Triggers**: All PRs, pushes to main/master, manual dispatch
- **What it does**: Basic checks, YAML validation, repository structure verification
- **Result**: Always runs, provides immediate feedback that CI is working

### 2. Molecule Tests (`molecule.yml`) 
- **Purpose**: Tests Ansible roles with Molecule
- **Triggers**: All PRs, pushes to main/master, manual dispatch
- **Smart Detection**: Only runs molecule tests if `playbooks/roles/` files changed
- **What it tests**: `apt_installs` role with git package installation

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

### When you create a PR:

1. **CI Workflow** will run immediately and show:
   ```
   🔍 CI is running!
   📁 Repository structure: [shows files]
   📁 Roles available: [shows roles]
   ✅ Checking YAML syntax...
   🎉 CI completed successfully!
   ```

2. **Molecule Workflow** will:
   - Check if roles changed
   - If YES: Run molecule test on `apt_installs` role
   - If NO: Show "Skipping molecule tests - no changes in playbooks/roles/"

### Expected PR Status:
- ✅ **CI** - Always passes (basic validation)
- ✅ **molecule** - Passes if role test succeeds, or skips if no role changes

## 🔧 How It Works

### Molecule Test Process:
1. Creates minimal `molecule.yml` with Ubuntu 22.04 container
2. Creates `converge.yml` with proper variables for `apt_installs` role
3. Runs: `molecule create → molecule converge → molecule destroy`
4. Reports success/failure clearly

### Why This Will Work:
- ✅ No complex Docker images (uses standard `ubuntu:22.04`)
- ✅ No systemd complexity (simple `sleep 60` command)
- ✅ Proper role variables provided inline
- ✅ Step-by-step execution with clear logging
- ✅ 10-minute timeout prevents hanging

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create/Update PR**: The workflows will trigger automatically
2. **Check Actions Tab**: You should see both "CI" and "molecule" workflows running
3. **Verify Results**: Both should show green checkmarks when complete

If you still don't see workflows running:
1. Check that workflows are in `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Ensure branch protection rules aren't blocking workflows
3. Check repository settings → Actions → General (should allow workflows)
